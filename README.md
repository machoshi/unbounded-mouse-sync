# UMS
## Easy Start
1. Fill in the ``Target IP`` blank and click on ``connect`` button to connect with other devices.
2. Check the screen scale of your device. For Windows users, click on the mouse right and open Display Settings. Find the scale and fill in the blank. Click ``set`` button to confirm.

3. Tick the check box ``Main Device`` for one of your device, and click on ``Start Unbounded Mouse`` for **3** times. The application will check if mouse is shared. 
4. Click on ``Open File`` and choose the file you want UMS to manage. Now you can easily transmit the file to your other device just by dragging it to the left screen bound.
